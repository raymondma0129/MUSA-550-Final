Together, we share an enthusiam for all things data and cities. This project was conceptualized during a professional visit we made to San Francisco in late 2023, where we observed first hand the city's overt reliance on personal vehicles as the preferred mode of transportation and the equity and sustainabilty challenges that come with it. 

We have created this project using Python, rendering on Quarto and published through Github pages. You can find more information about us on our personal websites linked above.
